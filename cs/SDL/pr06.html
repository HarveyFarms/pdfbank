A good foundation of reusable classes can speed up development time and allow focus to be on creating a great game rather than struggling with low-level code. This book aims to show an approach to creating a reusable framework that could be used for any game, whether 2D or 3D.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with SDL">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting started with SDL</em></span>, covers setting up SDL in Visual C++ 2010 express and then moves onto the basics of SDL including creating a window and listening for quit events.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Drawing in SDL">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Drawing in SDL</em></span>, covers the development of some core drawing classes to help simplify SDL rendering. The <code class="literal">SDL_image</code> extension is also introduced to allow the loading of a variety of different image file types.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Working with Game Objects">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Working with Game Objects</em></span>, gives a basic introduction to inheritance and polymorphism along with the development of a reusable <code class="literal">GameObject</code> class that will be used throughout the rest of the book.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Exploring Movement and Input Handling">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Exploring Movement and Input Handling</em></span>, gives a detailed look at handling events in SDL. Joystick, keyboard, and mouse input are all covered with the development of reusable classes.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Handling Game States">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Handling Game States</em></span>, covers the design and implementation of a finite state machine to manage game states. Implementing and moving between different states is covered in detail.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Data-driven Design">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Data-driven Design</em></span>, covers the use of TinyXML to load states. A class to parse states is developed along with examples for different states.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Creating and Displaying Tile Maps">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating and Displaying Tile Maps</em></span>, brings together everything from the previous chapters to allow the creation of levels using the Tiled map editor. A level parsing class is created to load maps from an XML file.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Creating Alien Attack">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Alien Attack</em></span>, covers the creation of a 2D side scrolling shooter, utilizing everything learned in the previous chapters.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Creating Conan the Caveman">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Creating Conan the Caveman</em></span>, covers the creation of a second game, altering the code from Alien Attack, showing that the framework is flexible enough to be used for any 2D game genre.</p></div></div></body></html>
