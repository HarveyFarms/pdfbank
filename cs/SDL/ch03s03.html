We can ensure this by making <code class="literal">GameObject</code> an abstract base class. An <a class="indexterm" id="id173"/>abstract base class cannot be initialized itself; its purpose is to dictate the design of derived classes. This gives us reusability as we know that any object we derive from <code class="literal">GameObject</code> will immediately work in the overall scheme of the game.</p><p>An abstract base class is a class that contains at least one pure virtual function. A pure virtual function is a function that has no definition and must be implemented in any derived classes. We can make a function pure virtual by suffixing it with <code class="literal">=0</code>.</p></div></body></html>
