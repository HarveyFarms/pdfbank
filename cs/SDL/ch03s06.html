We have covered the ability to easily create classes without having to rewrite a lot of similar functionality and the use of inheritance and how it allows us to share code between similar classes. We looked at polymorphism and how it can make object management a lot cleaner and reusable while abstract base classes took our inheritance knowledge up a notch by creating the blueprint we want all of our objects to follow. Finally, we put all our new knowledge into the context of our framework.</p></div></body></html>
