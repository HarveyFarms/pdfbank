We learned what SDL is and why it is a great tool for game development. We looked at the overall structure of a game and how it can be broken into individual parts, and we started to develop the skeleton of our framework by creating a <code class="literal">Game</code> class that can be used to initialize SDL and render things to the screen. We also had a small look at how SDL handles events by listening for a <code class="literal">quit</code> event to close our application. In the next chapter we will look at drawing in SDL and building the <code class="literal">SDL_image</code> extension.</p></div></body></html>
