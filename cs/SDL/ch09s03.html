Tile-map collision was also covered, along with the important point of splitting x and y movement for effective movement in a platform game. Conan the Caveman is a great starting point for any other 2D game such as a scrolling beat-em-up or even a merging of this chapter and the last to create a platform shooter.</p><p>I hope that by now you have a good understanding of how to use SDL2.0 along with C++ to create games and how to effectively break game code apart to create a reusable framework. This is only the start and there are many more game-programming adventures ahead. Good luck!</p></div></body></html>
