We have created states for menus, pause, play, and game over with each state having its own functionality and being handled using FSM. The <code class="literal">Game</code> class now uses FSM to render and update game objects and it does not now handle objects directly, as each individual state handles its own objects. We have also created simple callback functions for our buttons using function pointers and static functions.</p></div></body></html>
